							<h2><small>How I converted an old Roomba Robot to use a custom lithium-ion polymer battery pack</small></h2>
							<div class="row-fluid">
								<div class="span12">
									<p>A friend gave me his old (original model) Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner some time back. He had lost the charger for it, but more importantly, the NiCd battery pack was really old and would no longer hold a charge - at least the way it used to. So I removed the original battery pack from the plastic casing.<br><br>
									I noted the dimensions of the OEM battery housing and planned to build up my own battery pack, from scratch. To meet the main DC voltage requirements for the Roomba, I needed 4-series Lithium-ion cells (3V min, 3.7V nominal, 4.2V max - per cell), so totaling a range between 12V to 16.8V. Since I had enough room in the battery's plastic case, and I wanted to ensure the robot could vacuum my entire apartment (at least once), I went with 2 parallel cells per each series cell.<br><br>
									I soldered together eight individual 1320 mAh lithium-ion polymer battery cells in a 4-series and 2-parallel (4s2p) arrangement, which I placed into the old battery's housing. I rewired the old metal-contact that was being used for a temperature line to instead serve as a "system present" pin. The temperature pin was no longer needed, since the fuel-gauge IC had its own internal temperature monitoring system (two thermistors, with four-tier software and hardware safety features). I wired a three-way switch to toggle between OFF/ON/SLEEP, using the metal contact as a simple and direct method to put the fuel-gauge IC into a low-power sleep mode - which minimizes power losses when the robot is not in active use.<br><br>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row-fluid">
								<div class="span6">
									The resultant battery pack is shown in this old casing (with its top removed to show the circuit board) when calibrating the fuel-gauge and running some (dis)charge cycle tests. To charge the battery, I used a COTS Li-ion polymer battery charger. I retrofitted a new plug into the robot's existing charger input - this way I can charge the battery while its plugged into the underside of the robot. I also dremeled out three sections on the battery's plastic casing. One to access the SMBus terminal plug, the second to view the LED battery status indicators, and a third to fit in a button for pressing to display the battery's remaining charge. The result looks really neat. So after some minimal rewiring and modifications, the robot worked great! It last much longer than it ever did (over 2 hours), and provides plenty of power to its motors.</p>

									<p>I designed these two printed circuit boards (PCBs) that are illustrated below. Both are very similar, but are retrofitted for use in slightly different battery packs. Each of these circuits are based on Texas Instruments' bq20z80A-v110 fuel-gauge chipset - which includes the bq29312A analog front-end IC. The left image shows a 2-series and 1-parallel (or 2s1p, for short) 1900 mAh lithium-ion polymer battery (LiPB) pack, whereas the right image shows a 1320 mAh 3s1p LiPB pack. In both pictures, you can see the finished PCBs as they look mounted on top of their respective battery pack (far left), the PCB fully populated but not attached to a battery (middle), and an unpopulated bare PCB (far right). Note, the 2s1p PCB is the PCB that has rounded edges.</p>

							<h2><small>An aquatic robot for collecting water samples</small></h2>
							<div class="row-fluid">
								<div class="span12">
									<p>I worked on this "Aqua-Pod Robot" project with a team of six engineers (including myself). Two mechanical engineers, one firmware/electrical engineer, two computer scientists, and me - the electrical engineer (a third mechanical engineer joined the team a year or so later). The purpose was to design a robot to facilitate assessing water contaminant levels in the marshlands of Louisiana, following the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in the summer of 2010 in the Golf of Mexico.<br><br>
									Given a general set of specifications from a group of geologists and other scientists, our role was to make these a reality. I was the lead electrical engineer on this project. My role was to realize all electronics inside and outside the robot. This included two custom PCBs (shown circled in the image below) - one of which was designed with the firmware/electrical engineer in the team (Sandeep Dhull) whom I was teaching how to do PCB layout in Eagle and the intricacies involved in such a system's design. In a similar fashion, we also architected everything electrical and electromechanical to the robot. This includes a variety of sensors (pressure, humidity, temperature, etc), a COTS single-board computer with an ARM processor (the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8755">Package Tracker</a> from Sparkfun), a GPS module, IP-68 water-resistant plugs and ports, and inter-board connections. In addition, there was a DC motor for buoyancy control, and two external servo motors for opening/closing the lids on viles for water sample collection.<br><br>
									This was a fun, yet challenging, project to work on. Designing and building a small (Frisbee-sized), submersible robot that reach up to 10 meters in depth, and collect water samples, is not an easy task. Sealing the robot, implementing the buoyancy control system, fitting 3 motors, 3 PCBs, 1 GPS module, a 2s1p 1900 mAh LiPB pack, 4 fairly large IP-68 compliant plugs and ports, and not to mention the custom wiring and harnesses running from one side of the robot to another (and in some cases to/from its exterior), all posed their own difficulties.</p>
